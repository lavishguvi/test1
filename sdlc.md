# Introduction to Virtualization and Cloud Computing






## · What is Internet: 
A global computer network using standardized 
communication protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP/IP) providing information and 
communication facilities.

## Local Network: Private network in LAN (Local Area Network)

## · Virtualization: 
Run multiple OSs on a host machine (Type 1: BareMetal, Uses Hypervisor OS (e.g. ESXi) and Type 2: Application running on another base OS (e.g. vmware workstation)).

## Virtual Machine: 
Software representation of virtual computer as set of files! Easy 
to move, independent of hardware, Effective utilization of resources. We can do 
virtual networking between VMs.

## · Data Center:
Data centers are simply centralized locations where computing and 
networking equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, 
processing, distributing or allowing access to large amounts of data.
## · What is Cloud? 
There is now Cloud, it is someone else's computer accessible over the Internet! Virtual Machine running on a cloud server is the most widely used way of hosting any applications online.

## · Cloud Computing: 
On demand delivery of IT resources via the Interment, Instead of setting up Physical DCs, we can access Compute, Network, Storage on demand basis from Cloud providers. Use cases: Data backup, DRS, Email, Virtual Desktop, Software Development, Testing, Web Apps, Online Gaming, IoT, etc. Worldwide availability.





























## What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?

· 
Applications like YouTube, Gmail, Facebook are software that are hosted on cloud. Those are often called Software as a Services (SaaS).
 Amazon Web Services is a public cloud provider, a gigantic pool of configurable resources (Servers, Storage, Networks, etc.) spanned across multiple Data Centers in the globe where you can deploy your infrastructure/ applications. Hence it is also called Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS).
IaaS – Entire Infrastructure provided to you as a fully managed service
Rapid provisioning and release of the resources.
Resources are elastic in nature; you can scale up and scale down the resources. (Scaling: Ability to change an implementation to respond to changing traffic patterns.). e.g. During Black Friday sale, services may require more compute power.
You can build could apps/ software (SaaS) using AWS (IaaS). Services can be used On-demand and Pay as you Go fashion (Like our Electricity bill, pay for the usage).
 We can gradually move services to Cloud (On-Ramp), some of the services are moved to cloud, often called Hybrid Cloud.
AWS follows strict regulations that allows Banking, Research sectors to move their infrastructure to cloud.
The collective money that we pay to Amazon, enables them to maintain the Data Centers all over the world.
Examples AWS Solutions: amazon.com, Netflix, etc. uses AWS in the backend.
